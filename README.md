## About Save System

The save system is a package for saving and loading game data.
This system allows you to save the state of the game at a some moment
and restore it after entering.

You can save the game in different ways - before exit;
automatically during each specified period; when the player
triggered any checkpoint; quick save at any time, etc.

In low level you can control unity structures such as Vector2,
Vector3, Vector4, Quaternion, Color, Color32, Matrix4X4, Mesh.

Also you can write down and read base data types and custom
classes and structures.
